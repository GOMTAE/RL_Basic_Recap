# Reinforcement Learning Basics Recap (by Taehyoung Kim)

This repository serves as a record of the ramping up process before starting my Masters thesis. The primary objective of this repo is to revisit the fundamental concepts of Reinforcement Learning and implement the basic algorithms from scratch.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a recap of the foundational concepts and algorithms of Reinforcement Learning. Through this process, I aim to enhance my understanding of the field and develop a strong foundation for my future research.

## Contents

The repository contains the following:

- Implementations of basic RL algorithms such as Q-Learning, SARSA, and Monte Carlo methods
- Reinforcement Learning concepts such as Markov Decision Processes, Value and Policy Iteration, and Model-based and Model-free RL
- Code samples and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how the algorithms and concepts work in practice
- Additional resources and references for further study

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone the repo to your local machine and explore the contents. The code samples and Jupyter notebooks are located in the `code` directory. The `README` file within each subdirectory contains more information about the contents of that directory.
